It's been a week and a half since I last worked on this. I've been getting things going on my new
projects. The Eldritch Adventures along with studying for CompTIA A+. I've also decided to learn
embedded systems because of this project. So I've been doind all of that while coming to terms
being stuck at the busier work location. In other words, I've been too tired to devote the brain
power to this one since I have to dive so deep into it at a time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My deep dive today consisted of figuring out how the MBC works. I've only worked on figuring out
the basics so far. And that took me an 1 - 1.5 hours to learn. This is because I'm adding in the
embedded systems portion to figure out how this would physically work as well as the emulator.

If I want to be correct with the structure, the GB struct will have a separate MBC struct. This
would take the curr_rom_bank out of the cartridge and place it in the MBC struct. I think it
would do the same for curr_ram_bank as well, and it would need to set all the correct MBC stuff
after reading the cartridge. For now, I'm going to stick to the current structure. I don't want
to confuse myself further until I figure the rest of it out.

I'll work on the actual implementation in a couple of days. I need to work on a few other things
since the next couple of days are going to be busy at work.
