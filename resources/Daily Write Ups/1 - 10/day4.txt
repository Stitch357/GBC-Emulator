Day 4 - 7/5/24
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I ran into a snag today. Quite a simple one when you get down to it, but I had no clue about
how to make CMakeLists.txt or launch.json files. I'm still not well versed in their uses but
I got them cobbled together to a workable state. For now...

Since my test roms are not ones I want distrubuted, I had to set up a relative path outside
of my repo. If anyone copies or wants to use this program, they will need to change the path
in the launch.json configuration file. For my uses it works perfectly fine.

The next step that I need to take is reading the ROM into my cartridge struct. From there, I
can start allocating the information that I need to build up the program some more. For
example, allocating the ROM and RAM based on the values read in. But I will have to figure
out how to move around the ROM code itself. I've used a hex editor to look at the ROM before
but I have no clue what it looks like when the program is running. I'm assuming that it's a
1 Mb long string of 0's and 1's so to speak.

By looking through the example GBC emulator, it looks like I can access the needed information
by just referencing the correct addresses. E.g. cart->rom[0x147] finds the type of MBC that
the cartridge uses.

I'll fiddle with all of this next time. But for now, I'm going to work on another project.
