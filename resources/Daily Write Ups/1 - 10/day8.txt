As a quick note, I'm not finding a ton about the Super Game Boy flag. The only thing that Pan docs
says is that the Super Game Boy will ignore command packets if the code isn't $03. Digging into
that it says that command packets are transferred from the Game Boy to the SNES.

ALong with that, I dug into what the Super Game Boy actually is. It was a peripheral device that
allowed the SNES to play Game Boy games. It wasn't a stand alone device, so there seems to be no
need for me to touch anything to do with it.

This leaves me with implementing the MBC codes and flags. Which means I need to research what exactly
they are.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I got severly distracted tonight while working on this. I took a detour to look through the geambouy
C implementation of the MBC. I have just about everything completed for the cartridge except for the
MBC implementation, saving, and freeing all the allocated memory. I also don't have anything for
reading or writing to the cartridge ROM or RAM. This stems from not understanding the MBC, and I
don't want to just copy their work without understanding it myself. I hate doing that and it won'that
help me in the long run.

I need to dive into researching about the MBC types to understand what they do. So far all I know is
that they control the memory bank switching. But I don't understand the how or why, yet.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I believe that it's time to start working on the CPU once again. At least while I try figuring out
the MBC. This way, I will at least be able to continue making progress on the project while I'm
figuring things out.

I'll be picking this project back up when I go back to work on Thursday. I want to spend some time
both planning The Eldritch Adventures of Kevin and Taco, along with putting my website together. I
want to get the website published by August 11th, which means I need to at least have a half dozen
articles polished and ready to publish. That'll give me a 3 month buffer of Bite Sized Game Design
articles while I'm getting more written. I also want a half dozen Bite Sized Psych articles written
so that I can publish those on the off weeks.

I also want to do a much longer deep dive into a topic that better references and researchs a topic.
